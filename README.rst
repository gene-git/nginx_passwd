###############
Getting Started
###############

Installation
============

Available on
 * `Github`_
 * `Archlinux AUR`_

On Arch you can build using the PKGBUILD provided in packaging directory or from the AUR package.
To build manually, clone the repo and do:

 .. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Manual Install

        rm -f dist/*
        /usr/bin/python -m build --wheel --no-isolation
        root_dest="/"
        ./scripts/do-install $root_dest

When running as non-root then set root\_dest a user writable directory

nginx_passwd application
========================

Usage
-----

To add or modify a user and write the resulting password file:
.. code:: bash

    nginx-passwd -f <password_file> <user>

If file is not specified, then the result is written to stdout.

The supported algortithms are::

    * Modern : argon2, pbkdf2_sha512, pbkdf2_sha256
    * Active : sha512, sha256, bcrypt
    * Deprecated: md5,  md5_apr1

and sha256 is the default.

These older and now deprecated algorithms are still supported but should be replaced by
one of the active ones::

    md5 and md5_apr1 

where *md5_apr1*, also known as *apr1*, is the old apache variant of md5.

-------

The options are given below and *nginx-passwd -h* provides a help summary.

    * Active : sha512, sha256, bcrypt
    * Deprecated: md5,  md5_apr1

  * (*-p, --passwd*) <password>  

    Password as an option. Without this it will be read from stdin.
